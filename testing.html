            <h2>🐾 Understanding Pet Adoption</h2>
            <p class="quote">"Adoption is not just about finding a pet; it’s about changing lives, theirs and
                yours." </p>

            <div class="note-content">
                <div class="note-text">
                    <h3>Why Adopt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Adopting a pet is a life-changing decision, both for you and the pet you bring home. Every
                        year,
                        millions of animals end up in shelters, longing for love and companionship. Adoption gives
                        these
                        animals a second chance at life, providing them with a warm home and a loving family.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Adoption Readiness</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before adopting, it's important to assess your lifestyle, living conditions, and commitment
                        level.
                        A pet requires time, attention, and proper care. Ask yourself:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Do I have enough time to care for a pet?</li>
                        <li>Can I afford pet food, vet bills, and other expenses?</li>
                        <li>Is my home pet-friendly and safe?</li>
                        <li>Am I ready for a long-term commitment (some pets live 10-20 years)?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How to Prepare for a New Pet</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bringing a pet home requires some preparation. Make sure you have:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🐾 A cozy bed and a safe space for your pet.</li>
                        <li>🐾 Food and water bowls suited to their needs.</li>
                        <li>🐾 Initial vet checkup scheduled.</li>
                        <li>🐾 Patience and love as they adjust to their new home.</li>

                                Bella was found trembling in the rain, abandoned and alone. Her tiny frame showed signs
                                of
                                malnourishment, and trust in humans seemed broken. But after weeks of love, patience,
                                and care,
                                Bella finally found her forever home—where she now enjoys belly rubs and sunny afternoon
                                naps.

                                Leo was once a stray, wary of people and fearful of affection. He spent his days hiding,
                                unsure of his
                                place in the world. But with the dedication of a kind rescuer, Leo learned that not all
                                humans hurt—some heal.
                                Today, he is a playful, loving pet who greets everyone with a wagging tail.

                                Daisy was left on the streets as a newborn kitten, struggling to survive. A kind-hearted

                                found her weak and hungry. After months of care and warmth, Daisy grew into a lively,

                                cat who now enjoys her days chasing butterflies in her new loving home.

                    <p>
                        Max was found in the cold, his ribs visible under his fur. He had been surviving alone,  
                        but he never lost his spirit. When the Thompson family took him in, he finally felt safe.  
                        “He stopped shaking when I held him,” says Mrs. Thompson. "That’s when I knew—he was home."

                        Bella was abandoned near a gas station, waiting for someone who would never return.  
                        She was so weak she could barely walk. But Jack stopped for her.  
                        "She put her paw on my hand, and I knew she trusted me," he says.  
                        Now, Bella is the happiest dog—always running to greet Jack at the door.
